# The Creative World

The Creative World is a dedicated space where players can freely experiment with their ideas and create entries for any build competitions hosted on Cobbleton Forever. It features plots that can be individually claimed, with the option to combine multiple plots for larger projects. Players have full control over their plots with PlotSquared's extensive flag system and can easily choose who gets access on their plot for collaborative builds.
