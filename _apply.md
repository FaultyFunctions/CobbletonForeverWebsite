## Joining the Server

Cobbleton Forever uses a graylist system. This means that you are able to connect to the server immediately but you won't be able to build unless you fill out a player application and are accepted. If you'd like to visit our server and check it out, you can connect with the IP `play.cobbleton.com`.

Once you've decided you'd like to join our community, you can head over to our [Discord server](https://cobbleton.com/discord) and fill out a player application from the `#apply` channel.

When you're accepted there is one last step you need to take. You need to login in-game and use the `/discord link` command to link your Minecraft and Discord accounts. This will award you with the player rank and you'll get full access to the server.

### TL;DR
1. Fill out a player application on [Discord](https://cobbleton.com/discord).
2. Once accepted, login in-game and use `/discord link` and follow the instructions.
