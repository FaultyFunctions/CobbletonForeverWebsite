## About Us

Cobbleton Forever is a community-oriented server where cooperation and collaboration are strongly encouraged. We aim for a positive and friendly atmosphere where players can enjoy building close to others without the need to worry about destruction. Our goal is to deliver the Minecraft experience you know, but also to supplement it with extra elements that we hope will make the multiplayer experience more enjoyable for everyone who wants to play.
